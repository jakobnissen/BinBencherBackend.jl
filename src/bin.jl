    Bin(name::AbstractString, sequences, targets)

`Bin`s each represent a bin created by the binner. Conceptually, they are simply
a set of `Sequence` with a name attached.
Practically, every `Bin` is benchmarked against all `Genome`s and `Clade`s of a given `Reference`,
so each `Bin` stores data about its intersection with every genome/clade, e.g. its purity and recall.

Like `Source`s, `Bin`s also have an _assembly size_ for a given source. This is the number
of base pairs in the source covered by any sequence in the `Bin`, which is always a subset
of the `Source`'s assembly size.

Benchmark statistics for a `Bin`/`Genome` can be done with either _assemblies
or _genomes_ as the ground truth.
* True positives (TP) are defined as the sum of assembly sizes over all sources in the genome
* False positives (FP) are the sum of length of sequences in the bin not mapping to the `Genome`
* False negatives (FN) is either the genome assembly size or genome size minus TP.

For `Bin`/`Clade` pairs B/C, recall is the maximal recall of B/Ch for all children Ch of C.
Precision is the sum of lengths of sequences mapping to any child of the clade divided
by the sum of lengths of all sequences in the bin.
